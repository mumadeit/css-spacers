Step 1: Link the CSS file
In the <head> section of your HTML document, include a link to the CSS file containing the spacing classes. For example:

html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./spacers.css">

Make sure to replace "path/to/spacing-classes.css" with the actual file path.

Step 2: Apply spacing classes
To apply the desired spacing to an HTML element, add the corresponding spacing class as a class attribute to that element. For example:

html

<div class="spacer-20">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

In this example, the <div> element will have a padding-block of 20 pixels, creating a vertical spacing of 20 pixels.

Step 3: Adjust the spacing as needed
You can choose the appropriate spacing class based on the amount of vertical spacing you want. If you need more space, use a class with a higher number. For example, if you want 50 pixels of vertical spacing, use the class spacer-50.

html

<div class="spacer-50">
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>

Step 4: Customize if necessary
If the provided spacing classes don't meet your specific requirements, you can customize the values in the CSS file. Simply modify the padding-block values for the desired spacing classes to suit your needs.

That's it! By following these steps, you can easily apply consistent vertical spacing to your web page or application using the provided spacing classes. Remember to adjust the class name and value as needed to achieve the desired vertical spacing between elements.
